## About the SLU DSS
### About the SLU Data Science Seminar
The [SLU Data Science Seminar](https://slu-dss.githb.io) (DSS) is a collaborative, interdisciplinary group at Saint Louis University focused on building researchers’ data science skills using open source software. We currently host seminars focused on the programming language R. The SLU DSS is co-organized by [Christina Gacia, Ph.D.](mailto:christina.garcia@slu.edu), [Kelly Lovejoy, Ph.D.](mailto:kelly.lovejoy@slu.edu), and [Christopher Prener, Ph.D.](mailto:chris.prener@slu.edu}).
